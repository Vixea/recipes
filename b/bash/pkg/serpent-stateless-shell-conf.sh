# scripts look inside /usr/share/defaults/etc/ for their preferred
# system-level default initialization files.

# For bash, this implies a fan-in configuation where both
# /usr/share/defaults/etc/profile and /usr/share/defaults/etc/bashrc
# source the present file, so as to ensure that there is no difference
# in the experience whether a user logs in via getty, via sshd or opens
# a new virtual terminal in a desktop environment.
#
# This should make testing configuration changes more straightforward.
